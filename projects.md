Below is a showcase of some projects I have worked on.

### [Machine Learning Optimizer](/assets/optimizers.pdf){:target="_blank"}

For the final project of a machine learning course, I worked with a group to survey the history of optimizers. For the first half of the course, we had covered some learning theory including Empirical Risk Minimization, VC Dimension, and Rademacher Complexity, as well as how SGD and Adam optimizers work. We hoped to delve deeper into understanding the theory behind the many optimizers used in machine learning research, thus producing this paper.

### [Japanase Art DCGAN](https://edward-qin.github.io/Japanese-Art-DCGAN/){:target="_blank"}

For the final project of a computer vision course, I worked with a partner to train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network for Japanese Art. Using 64 by 64 pixel images from the [WikiArt Art Movement/Styles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sivarazadi/wikiart-art-movementsstyles){:target="_blank"} dataset, we produced some images that matched the Japanese Art style from the era, but lacked distinct features that defined objects. This was largely due to our incorrect approach of not training over iterations of incrementing image sizes (i.e. from 16x16, then 32x32, and finally 64x64), and our still relatively small image size. However, this was a rewarding experience both in learning about how the GAN model works and gaining hands-on experience with training computer vision models.

### [Daily Tab Opener Firefox Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/daily-url-opener/){:target="_blank"}

During one school break, I felt the need to motivate myself. I found that I was unmotivated to practice Leetcode interview problems. I had also been wanting to read the daily xkcd comic. As such, I figured it would be a smart idea to make a tool that could help me. As such, this was a self-contained, one-week project where I learned the basics of browser extensions and submitted it to the Firefox Add-Ons store.

### [PhotoFilter App](https://github.com/edward-qin/PhotoFilter){:target="_blank"}

learned image manipulation
work with react native
basic full stack project using server framework [SparkJava](https://sparkjava.com/)

### Distributed Key-Value Store and Other Course Projects

no link since this was course project
really enjoyed learning design docs, debugging features
Other course projects have included MiniJava compiler, Flight transactions database, C/C++ file/web search index.
