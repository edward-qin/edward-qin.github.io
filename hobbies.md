I enjoy working on the occasional side project. This especially applies for things that can be useful to me. For instance, to motivate myself to practice leetcode (and also to read daily comics), I wrote a small, self-contained Firefox extension to open tabs once per day so that I would not need to manually type in the url every day.

I also enjoy going to computer science theory talks, even if I do not understand half of the presentation. It is always exciting to hear about new theoretical results and identifying what ideas I can follow based on previous theory coursework.

Additionally, throughout college, I have been playing as a cellist in the University of Washington [Campus Philharmonic Orchestra](https://music.washington.edu/ensembles/campus-philharmonia-orchestras){:target="_blank"}. I also play in a string quartet and occasionally for the UW [Music for Charity Club](https://muscharity.wordpress.com/).

My other hobbies include occasionally playing badminton with friends, watching anime, trying new restaurants on the UW Ave, and attempting to get better at cooking.
