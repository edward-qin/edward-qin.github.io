Hello! I am a student studying computer science under the combined BS/MS program at the University of Washington. 

motivated by 2 things: computer science and education/learning/teaching

Throughout my coursework and work experiences, I have found an increasing passion in computer science. In particular, I am fascinated by the subfields of computer science theory and systems. I have also found that I enjoy teaching computer science as a teaching assistant for the UW Allen School.

In the short-term, my goals lie in software engineering. I hope to build meaningful solutions, applying both systems and theoretical knowledge into my work.

In the long-term, I hope to incorporate teaching into my career. I hope to teach either part-time or eventually full-time as a teaching professor.
