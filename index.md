Hello! I am a student studying computer science under the combined BS/MS program at the University of Washington. My primary interests lie in computer science and education. 

Throughout my coursework and work experiences, I have found an increasing passion in computer science. In particular, I am fascinated by the subfields of computer science theory and systems. I enjoy theory for its problem-solving and logical proof-writing aspects, and I my current exploration of distributed systems stems from my fascination with the protocols discussed in a course I recently took.

I have also found that I enjoy teaching computer science as a teaching assistant for the UW Allen School. I have always been fond of learning, and likewise, teaching has been an additionally rewarding experience. I am thrilled by the prospect of not only bolstering my own expertise in the subject, but also supporting students' learning in these captivating subjects.

My current goals lie in software engineering. I hope to build meaningful solutions while fortifying my technical expertise, applying both systems and algorithmic knowledge into my work. In the long-term, I hope to incorporate teaching into my career, either part-time or eventually full-time as a teaching professor.
