## About

Hello! I am a combined BS/MS computer science student at the University of Washington. 

Throughout my coursework and work experiences, I have found an increasing passion in computer science. In particular, I am very interested in the subfields of computer science theory and systems. I have also found that I enjoy teaching computer science as a teaching assistant for the UW Allen School.

My goals for the future include swe, possible teaching later on
