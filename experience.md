## Teaching

### Teaching Assistant<br><sup><em>University of Washington Paul G. Allen School</em></sup>

At UW, I have been a teaching assistant for CSE 312 (probability and statistics) for 3 quarters and CSE 421 (algorithms) for 1 quarter. I feel that I have gained significant technical and problem solving skills as I learn to not only understand the content, but also how to effectively communicate how students can approach probability problems and design algorithms. Additionally, I have gained extraordinary soft skills, where I am required to practice effective communication while co-leading weekly discussion sections, hosting weekly office hours, and answering questions on the question board. 

### Volunteer Tutor<br><sup><em>Little Master's Club </em></sup>

Throughout high school, I was a volunteer tutor for a reading club that taught English to elementary and middle schoolers in China. I believe that my passion for teaching stemmed from here.
