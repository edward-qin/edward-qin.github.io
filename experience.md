## Industry

### Software Engineer Intern<br><sup><em>[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/){:target="_blank"}</em></sup>

At Snowflake, I gained many technical and soft skills. On the technical side, I learned how to write design docs and translate system calls for resource usage into visualized observability metrics. More importantly, I learned valuable professional skills like taking ownership of my project, reaching out frequently to multiple members of the team for guidance and feedback, and communicating effectively with the team. This experience was a valuable  insight into the tech industry, and confirmed my passion for work on meaningful projects using my technical skills.

### Computational Science Intern<br><sup><em>[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/){:target="_blank"}</em></sup>

At PNNL, I learned to build a battery cathode model simulation at a customer-facing level. I worked closely with the research team, holding frequent meetings to understand the usage of our model, and learned the importance of ensuring full understanding of the specifications. By building a model of the chemical process that the research team could then use as an heuristic for the ratios of materials used in the lab obtaining maximal conductance, the team could save many physical resources. This direct impact of my work invoked my passion for building things with meaningful impact.

### Intern<br><sup><em>[Goodwell Technologies](https://www.goodwelltech.com/){:target="_blank"}</em></sup>

As a high school intern at Goodwell Technologies, I was welcomed into the industry, especially gaining experience working at a small company and startup-like culture. This major learning experience helped shaped my interests in technology and business, and helped me better understand the indstury, including the importance of business strategy, web security, and accessiblity.

## Teaching

### Teaching Assistant<br><sup><em>[University of Washington Paul G. Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"}</em></sup>

At UW, I have been a teaching assistant for CSE 312 (Probability and Statistics) for 4 quarters and CSE 421 (Algorithms) for 1 quarter. I feel that I have gained significant technical and problem solving skills as I learn to not only understand the content, but also how to effectively communicate how students can approach probability problems and design algorithms. Additionally, I have gained valuable soft skills, where I am required to practice effective communication while leading weekly discussion sections, hosting weekly office hours, and answering questions on the question board. 

### Volunteer Tutor<br><sup><em>[Little Master's Club](https://littlemastersclub.org/){:target="_blank"}</em></sup>

Throughout high school, I was a volunteer tutor who taught English to elementary and middle schoolers in China. I was motivated to understand what the students wanted to get out of our time and consequently tailored reading material that aligned with the students' interests. As a result, I believe that my passion for teaching stemmed from this direct impact I had on the students' learning.
